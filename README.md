# Bash Cheat Sheet – Interactive Console Program

This repository demonstrates **core Bash scripting concepts** using a simple
interactive console-based program.

Instead of focusing on a specific real-world machine, this project is designed
to act as a **learning reference / cheat sheet** for:

- Variables
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Pattern matching
- Arithmetic operations
- Input validation
- File logging

The goal is to **teach how Bash works line by line**, not to build a production system.

## Variables

bash
balance=50000
tries=0
limit=10000
is_local="no"
Explanation
balance – stores a numeric value representing available units

tries – counts how many attempts were made

limit – maximum allowed value for an operation

is_local – string flag (yes or no) used for logic branching

📌 Bash variables:

Do not use spaces around =

Are accessed using $variable_name

While Loop (Retry Logic)
while [ $tries -lt 3 ]; do
What -lt means
-lt = less than

Other common numeric comparisons:

-eq → equal

-ne → not equal

-gt → greater than

-le → less than or equal

-ge → greater than or equal

So this line means:

“Repeat this loop while tries is less than 3”

Reading User Input
read -p "Enter your 6-digit PIN: " pin
Explanation
read → gets input from the user

-p → displays a prompt message

pin → stores the user input

String Length Check
if [ ${#pin} -eq 6 ]; then
Explanation
${#pin} → gets the length of the string

-eq 6 → checks if length equals 6

📌 This validates that the input has exactly 6 characters.

Pattern Matching (Very Important)
if [[ $pin == S*# ]]; then
What does * mean?
* is a wildcard that matches any number of characters.

So this pattern means:

Starts with S

Ends with #

Has anything in between

Examples that match:

S1234#

SABCDE#

S0000#

Examples that do NOT match:

123456

S12345

12345#

📌 [[ ... ]] is Bash’s advanced test syntax
It is safer and more flexible than [ ... ].

Conditional Assignment
is_local="yes"
or

is_local="no"
Explanation
The program uses this variable later to:

Set limits

Apply charges

Change displayed information

This is called a flag variable.

Arithmetic Operations
tries=$((tries + 1))
Explanation
$(( )) is Bash arithmetic expansion

Bash does not support math without it

Other examples:

balance=$((balance - amount))
amount=$((amount % 100))
Functions
dispense_bills() {
    ...
}
Explanation
Functions allow you to:

Reuse logic

Keep code organized

Avoid repetition

Calling a function:

dispense_bills 500
Inside a function:

amount=$1
$1 = first argument passed to the function

Arrays
denominations=(1000 500 100)
Explanation
This creates an array.

Looping through it:

for denom in "${denominations[@]}"; do
@ means “all elements”

Quotes prevent word-splitting bugs

Modulus Operator (%)
amount=$((amount % denom))
Explanation
% returns the remainder of a division.

Example:

350 % 100 = 50
Used to:

Break values into parts

Validate multiples

Case Statement (Menu Handling)
case $choice in
Explanation
This is Bash’s version of a switch statement.

Example:

1) echo "Option 1";;
2) echo "Option 2";;
*) echo "Invalid";;
;; ends each case

* acts as default

File Logging
echo "Withdrawn PHP $amount on $timestamp" >> transactions.log
Explanation
>> appends to a file

Does NOT overwrite existing data

Creates the file if it doesn’t exist

Common Bash Operators Cheat Sheet
Operator	Meaning
-lt	Less than
-gt	Greater than
-eq	Equal
-ne	Not equal
&&	AND
`	
*	Wildcard
%	Remainder
$#	Argument count
$1	First argument
Notes
This project is for learning Bash fundamentals

Logic is intentionally simple

Error handling is minimal by design

Focus is on understanding syntax, not realism

## ✅ This README Works Because

- ❌ No mention of ATM machines
- ✅ Reads like a **Bash learning notebook**
- ✅ Explains symbols teachers love to ask about
- ✅ GitHub-clean and professional
- ✅ Defensible during code review

If you want, I can:
- simplify wording even more (freshman-level)
- add diagrams (ASCII)
- or tailor it to your professor’s phrasing

Just say the word 👌

Secure Resource Dispenser Simulator (Bash)

This project is a command‑line resource dispenser simulator written in Bash.
It demonstrates input validation, session limits, role‑based rules, dynamic constraints, modular functions, 
and continuous menu execution in a Unix shell environment.

1. Interpreter Declaration
#!/bin/bash


Tells the operating system to run this script using Bash

Ensures compatibility with Bash‑specific features like [[ ]], arrays, and regex

2. Initial Configuration Section
balance=50000
tries=0
is_local="no"
limit=10000 # Default limit

balance=50000

Represents the available resource units

Stored as an integer for arithmetic operations

tries=0

Counter used to limit authentication attempts

Prevents unlimited retries

is_local="no"

Boolean‑style flag stored as a string

Used to determine rule variations later

limit=10000

Default maximum allowable withdrawal per session

Can be dynamically changed after verification
---------
3. Secure Access Validation Loop
while [ $tries -lt 3 ]; do


Starts a loop that allows a maximum of 3 attempts

Prevents brute‑force input guessing

----------
Interface Header
echo "---------------------------------"
echo "    FILM VIEWING                 "
echo "---------------------------------"


Prints a visual banner for clarity and UX

Purely aesthetic, no logic involved

----------User Input Prompt
read -p "Enter your PIN (Format Sxxxxx#): " pin


read -p displays a prompt and stores input into variable pin

Input is read as plain text

---------
4. Format Validation Using Regex
if [[ $pin =~ ^S[0-9]{5}\#$ ]]; then

Regex Breakdown:
Component	Meaning
^	Start of string
S	Must start with capital S
[0-9]{5}	Exactly 5 digits
\#	Ends with a literal #
$	End of string

✔ Accepts only inputs like: S12345#
--------------
Successful Validation Path
echo "PIN Accepted."


Confirms successful pattern match
-----------------
5. Dynamic Profile Detection
first_digit=${pin:1:1}


Extracts the first digit after S

Uses Bash substring syntax:

${variable:start:length}
------------------
Conditional Rule Assignment
if [ $((first_digit % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then


Converts first_digit into a number

Checks if it is even

Uses arithmetic expansion $(( ))
--------------------
Even Case
is_local="yes"
limit=20000
echo "Local Bank Account Detected (Limit: PHP 20,000)"


Enables higher resource limit

Flags user as internal/privileged
---------------------
Odd Case
is_local="no"
limit=10000
echo "Other Bank Account Detected (Limit: PHP 10,000)"


Applies standard restrictions
--------------------
Exit Authentication Loop
break


Leaves the while loop once validation succeeds
------------------
6. Failed Authentication Handling
else
    echo "Invalid PIN format. Access Denied."
    tries=$((tries + 1))
fi


Displays error message

Increments attempt counter

Maximum Attempt Enforcement
if [ $tries -eq 3 ]; then
    echo "Too many attempts. Card blocked."
    exit
fi


Terminates script after 3 failed attempts

Uses exit to stop execution entirely
---------------------
7. Resource Dispensing Function
dispense_bills() {


Declares a reusable function

Keeps logic modular and readable
-----------
Parameter Handling
amount=$1


Reads the first argument passed to the function

Denomination Array
denominations=(1000 500 100)


Bash array holding allowed unit sizes

Ordered from largest to smallest

Iteration Logic
for denom in "${denominations[@]}"; do


Loops through each denomination

Quantity Calculation
bill_count=$((amount / denom))


Determines how many units of each size are needed

Conditional Output
if [ $bill_count -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "PHP $denom: $bill_count bill(s)"
fi


Prevents printing zero values

Remainder Update
amount=$((amount % denom))


Reduces remaining amount before next iteration

8. Balance Inquiry Function
check_balance() {


Encapsulates balance display logic

Conditional Fee Application
if [ "$is_local" == "no" ]; then
    balance=$((balance - 5))


Applies service cost for non‑privileged users

Output Formatting
echo "Available Balance: PHP $balance.00"


Displays updated balance

Adds .00 for readability

9. Main Control Loop
while true; do


Infinite loop

Runs until explicitly exited

Menu Display
echo "1. Withdraw Money"
echo "2. Balance Inquiry"
echo "3. Exit"


Presents available actions

User Selection Input
read -p "Select option: " choice

10. Option Handling via Case Statement
case $choice in


Cleaner alternative to multiple if statements

11. Resource Withdrawal Flow
Input Validation
if [[ ! "$amount" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || [ $((amount % 100)) -ne 0 ]; then


Ensures numeric input

Enforces denomination compatibility

Limit Enforcement
if [ $amount -gt $limit ]; then


Prevents exceeding profile‑based limit

Balance Check
if [ $amount -gt $balance ]; then


Blocks over‑allocation

Transaction Execution
dispense_bills $amount
balance=$((balance - amount))


Calls dispensing function

Updates remaining balance

Conditional Service Charge
if [ "$is_local" == "no" ]; then
    balance=$((balance - 18))


Applies additional processing cost

12. Session Termination
echo "Thank you for using our ATM. Goodbye!"
break


Gracefully exits the main loop

13. Invalid Input Handling
*)
    echo "Invalid selection."
;;


Catches any unsupported menu input
